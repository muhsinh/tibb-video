# Run Log

Use this file for anything the CSV can’t capture cleanly:
- UI changes
- queue times
- weird failure modes (birds, human-y blobs, cabins, trails, text)
- exact knobs used (guidance, style, negative prompt text, seeds)

## Notes (2026-02-04)
- Three videos are from Luma Labs Ray 3.14 (add them to: 01_raw/t2v/ with the naming convention).
